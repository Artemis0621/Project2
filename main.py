"""
My Python application idea is a personal finance manager.

The application will have the following features:

    - Users can create an account to track their expenses and income.
    - Users can add categories for their expenses and income, such as "rent," "groceries," "salary,"
     "freelance income," etc.
    - Users can add transactions, including the date, category, amount, and a short description.
    - Users can view summary statistics, such as total income, total expenses, net income,
     and average spending per category.
    - Users can export their data to a CSV file.

To implement this application, the following components will be used:

    1.) Validation of input received by the application:
    	- Validate user input, such as email and password during registration and login.
    	- Validate transaction data, such as the date, amount, and category ensuring they are the correct format and range.

    2.) Exception handling to deal with runtime errors:
    	- Handle runtime errors, such as database connection errors, file I/O errors, and user input errors.
    	- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

    4.) Code organized with the help of classes or modules:
    	- Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
    	- Use modules to separate concerns and improve code readability and maintainability.

    5.) Data stored in files/databases:
    	- Use a CSV file to export user data.

    6.) Proper code documentation:
    	- Use descriptive variable names to make code more readable.
    	- Use docstrings for functions/methods to document their purpose and input/output parameters.
    	- Use type hinting to make code more maintainable and easier to understand.
    	- Use descriptive commit messages to track changes and document the development process.

Overall, this personal finance manager is a complex Python application that incorporates various elements of software
development, including validation, exception handling, code organization, data storage, and documentation.
