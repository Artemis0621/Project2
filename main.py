"""
My Python application idea is a personal finance manager.

The application will have the following features:

    - Users can create an account and log in to track their expenses and income.
    - Users can add categories for their expenses and income, such as "rent," "groceries," "salary,"
     "freelance income," etc.
    - Users can add transactions, including the date, category, amount, and a short description.
    - Users can view their expenses and income over time, filtered by date range and category.
    - Users can view summary statistics, such as total income, total expenses, net income,
     and average spending per category.
    - Users can export their data to a CSV file or a database may be created to store and process user data (undecided).

To implement this application, the following components will be used:

    1.) Validation of input received by the application:
    	- Validate user input, such as email and password during registration and login.
    	- Validate transaction data, such as the date, amount, and category ensuring they are the correct format and range.

    2.) Exception handling to deal with runtime errors:
    	- Handle runtime errors, such as database connection errors, file I/O errors, and user input errors.
    	- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

    4.) An intuitive GUI for the application:
    	- Use a GUI framework, such as PyQt or Tkinter, to create an interactive interface.
    	- Design an easy-to-use interface for adding and viewing transactions, filtering data, and exporting data.

    5.) Code organized with the help of classes or modules:
    	- Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
    	- Use modules to separate concerns and improve code readability and maintainability.

    6.) Data stored in files/databases:
    	- Use a database, such as SQLite or MySQL, to store user data.
    	- Use a CSV file to export user data.

    7.) Proper code documentation:
    	- Use descriptive variable names to make code more readable.
    	- Use docstrings for functions/methods to document their purpose and input/output parameters.
    	- Use type hinting to make code more maintainable and easier to understand.
    	- Use descriptive commit messages to track changes and document the development process.

Overall, this personal finance manager is a complex Python application that incorporates various elements of software
development, including validation, exception handling, GUI development, code organization, data storage,
and documentation.
